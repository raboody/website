    		<ul class = publications style = "font-size:99%;"> 
    			<li> On babies' abilities: <br>"There is also evidence [that children may have] inaccurate conceptions of babies’ abilities. In one survey of beliefs about abilities at different ages, for example, 31% of 4-year-olds judged that babies could talk (Dowker, Hart, Heal, Phillips, & Wilson, 1994)." <br>- Miller, Hardin & Montgomery (2003)</li>

				<li> On magical metaphors: <br> "Specifically, for the metaphorical statement “The prison guard was a hard rock”, 6- and 7-year-olds [often gave] literal interpretations that involved magic (“The king had a magic rock and he turned the guard into another rock”)..." <br>- Grigoroglou & Papafragou (2017), Acquisition of Pragmatics</li>

    			<li> On children's use of the word "know": <br>"(e.g. The adult takes the child to the bathroom when she gets up in the morning. Child: ‘I haven’t peed on Grandma’s bed. You know that?’)." <br>- Harris, Yang & Cui (2017)</li>
    			
    			<li> One little rebel: <br> "When looking only at the first trial, 79% (11 ⁄ 14) of the pointing infants pointed on that trial. The first point in the first trial was equally often directed toward the target container (5 ⁄ 10) or the distractor container (5 ⁄ 10), Binominal test, p = 1, and one infant pointed with both arms to both containers at the same time." <br>- Knudsen & Liszkowski (2012)</li>
    			
    			<li> On teeth: <br>"[Children] were confident that the tooth fairy exists "because who takes all your teeth if there's no tooth fairy?"" <br>- Paul Harris, Trusting What You're Told</li>

    			<li> A dignified excerpt from a corpus analysis of children's mental-state language: <br>Father: "I think it's coal" <br> Child: "No, it's poop!" <br>- Sabbagh & Callanan, 1998</li>
    			
    			<li> On the joys and challenges of developmental research: <br> "Pilot testing...demonstrated that younger children have trouble with the paper task, and that many simply began drawing pictures on the stimulus sheets." <br>- Duffy, Toriyama, Itakura & Kitayama, 2008</li>

    			<li> Shots fired: <br> "One knows some things by virtue of being a sentient human being (e.g., the difference between pleasure and pain), others because of living in New England (e.g., the difference between New England—real—clam chowder and the Manhattan variety)..." <br>- Nickerson, 1999</li>

    			<li> #restingneutralface: <br> "In piloting, we have found that actresses who maintain an entirely neutral expression throughout the gaze sequences are judged as “grim”, “scary”, and not socially engaging." <br>- Wang & Hamilton, 2014 </li>

    			<li> On Bayesian data analysis: <br> "Here is a list of things that have been identified as cancer risks: electric razors; broken arms (but only in women); fluorescent lights; allergies; breeding reindeer; being a waiter; owning a pet bird; being short; being tall; and hot dogs. And, in case anyone is feeling safe - having a refrigerator. We are apparently all at risk. These results were not produced by Bayesian methods." <br>- Steven N. Goodman, Clinical Trials Presentation, 2005 </li>

    			<li> #science <br> "In a pretest, we confirmed that chocolates were more desirable than feces." <br>- Balcetis & Dunning, 2010</li>

    			<li> Best pop culture reference in an academic paper goes to: <br> "Taken together, these results suggest that during the preschool years, children transition from being “Socially Malleable Threes” to “Forget You Fours” (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKxodgpyGec" class = external>see Cee-Lo Green, 2010</a>). What developments foster this shift to greater non-conformist thinking and resistance to social pressure, at least in context of the artifact function domain?" <br>- Seston & Kelemen, 2013</li>
