					<p id = "paragraph_main" style = "font-size: 140%;";>Women (and especially women of color) report being challenged more often than male peers. Beyond making women feel unwelcome, I show that these questions can also devalue womens' credibility. In a study, two women provided information to a male character. He pointedly questioned one woman, asking, "Why would you say that?" But he endorsed the other woman's knowledge, asking a follow-up question to learn more from her. Concerningly, adults wanted to avoid learning from the woman who was disbelieved—even though they didn't know why the main character had questioned her.
					<br>
					<br>
					These results demonstrate that our phrasing choices can have major effects on others' credibility. This suggests that a culture of asking genuine follow-ups (vs. assuming others are wrong) may increase women's credibility in subtle but potentially meaningful ways.

				<div class = "blurb">
					<p id = "paragraph_main" style = "font-size: 140%;";>A recent analysis found that 80% of blogs denying climate change got their information from a single primary source (worse, this source had no formal qualifications as a climate researcher). But does this sort of widespread misinformation—involving the mere repetition of information across many sources—actually affect people's beliefs? We found that it does; adults seem to find widely-repeated information from a single source just as persuasive as information that is corroborated by multiple independent sources. 
					<br>
					<br>
					These results suggest we can be more mindful consumers of information if we consider where it came from. But on a higher level, this suggests that news aggregators and social media sites ought to cite their sources, explicitly warning readers when information is merely widely-repeated, and when it is independently generated by multiple experts.

					<p id = "paragraph_main" style = "font-size: 140%;";>If you're like me, at some point in your life you gave a passerby directions—and then a few hours later, realized your instructions were incomplete. Why do we sometimes make mistakes when we share knowledge with others? I find that when we teach, adults often assume others know more than they actually do. This leads us to be under-informative when sharing knowledge.
					<br>
					<br>
					These results suggest that when we teach, we might benefit from spending more time figuring out what our learners know. And at a higher level, tools that help remind teachers what their learners know (and critically, what they do not) may lead to more effective teaching <i>and</i> learning.
